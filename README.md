This project is called “Get It Done”, and contains the basic implementation of a student planner app in which users are able to register for an account, login to their account, and then proceed to add/delete tasks to and from the database associated with their login information. Once the user has successfully registered for an account, they are then able to log into the “Get ‘Er Done” app. When logging in, if the login information does not match any entries in the user registration database the user will be prompted to re-enter correct login info and offer to be redirected to the registration page. Upon successful login, the user is then redirected to the main page of list item tasks. On the tasks home page, the user can then enter a task with it’s concurrent class and due date, which is then saved to the database and then displayed to the DOM. Upon completion of the task, the user can click the ‘x’ button on each task, removing it from the database as well as removing it from the DOM. Upon successful logout of the app the user is redirected to the Home page again where they’re again asked to either login or register for a new account. You can deploy the website through docker using a container and deploying it on heroku.
